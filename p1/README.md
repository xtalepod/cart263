feelings i can’t control, 2020
christale terris is an emerging interdisciplinary artist whose body of work explores and instigates collective resistance. in feelings i can’t control they turn inward to investigate one of the most intense feelings shared on a collective level: love. with 8 different types as prescribed by the greeks, love is an inescapable building block for strong bonds between humans but we all know it doesn’t come easy and sometimes can fuck us right up.  feelings i can’t control, is a personal and playful jab at attempting to understand ‘love’ as a demisexual/demiromantic queer with an anxious attachment style and a tendency towards limerance.

characterized as a form of involuntary and obsessive desire to have ones feelings reciprocated, limerance is like pushing a boulder up a mountain you never agreed to hike and then doing it over and over again. the intrusive thoughts associated with limerence can typically last anywhere from 18 months to beyond 10 years -_-. once engaged with this cycle, eros, perhaps the most sought after form of love, becomes a less appealing venture by the minute but with 7 other types of love (and platonic being the most prized by the greeks) – maybe society has it all wrong. it all sounds so deep but tbh,  feelings i can’t control isn’t, and I just wanted to make a tiny tacky contribution to the dumpster fire that is love.

user interaction in this piece are simply a practice in jQuery and jQuery UI, and meant to induce an involuntary and obsessive desire to click the buttons and pray for the solution to letting go. if you ask enough times for love will the object of your desire change their mind? if you hear no enough times, will you really be okay? will you finally embark on the profound journey to self love (or philautia as the greeks say)? how many wiki hows does a person have to read before they master letting go?

once you tire of clicking because you’ve learned that things don’t change and all you can do is repeat the mantra “i love myself”, why not scroll down memory lane? journals don’t lie and neither do dates. an elaborated future form of this section could include links to queer theory and alternative forms of love but for now we just know the basics.

at the end of the day, what is there really left to do then set the world ablaze and make that dumpster fire lit? any ‘good’ millennial queer knows, dolly can heal wounds with her stories, so relax put your head phones on and set that dumpster aflame. then when you’re ready, just hit refresh and do it all over again – maybe this time it’ll be different, maybe this time you’ll learn your lesson.
