WHISPERS is an interactive soundscape generator inspired by ASMR and electroacoustic music. The simple interface allows the user to write poems by selecting words which can then be played back for listening, and if desired built upon. The words are divided into three categories: dark, light, and neutral. Two of categories or “moods” have effects built into them which alter the overall feeling of the soundscape depending on the predominant type in a sentence.
In order to create the soundscapes I experimented with many of the functions the open source library, Pizzicato.js, offers. This library has built in effects and the ability to create sound objects that are modular, two features I found very appealing to play with. At the effect level, I feel I’ve only just started to explore the potential of the library, but enjoyed the ease at which I was able to bedazzle my simpler sounds by using the addEffect() function. Part of my creative process included pre-recording my sound objects in Audacity, editing the audio to remove noise, and creating the individual audio files. The file names match the word objects, allowing the code to be used creatively by passing the same array when the objects are created in the script.  One of the most difficult aspects of the code was applying the effects to the specific word groups, tracking their score, and getting them to play sequentially using Pizzicato’s on end event.
It is also possible to build your own synthesizers by combining Pizzicato’s sound object feature with jQuery events and JavaScript functions. This simple process involved choosing my own frequencies and changing them over time like a natural chord progression using the setInterval() function. By creating my own synths, I was able to build the sound scape up and define the ‘mood’ better. I’m not an experienced musician by any means, but this process gave me a lot of pleasure and I can imagine growing this idea into something more elaborate in the future.
In addition to Pizzicato, I continued to work with jQuery as a creative medium for designing engaging code. To help the user understand how their choice of words will impact the overall environment, there are some hints. Using the jQuery library, I added hover() events to light and dark words and accessed the css properties of the images on the page. When the user hovers over one of these words, the corresponding image will get lighter or darker. During this event, the individual sounds also play back so that the user can hear before choosing. To select a word, the jQuery click() event is used and the background colour changes in set increments depending on the amount of light or dark words in a sentence. For example, the more dark words there are, the closer to black the background will become. This simple feature adds a lot to the visual dynamism of the piece. -->
