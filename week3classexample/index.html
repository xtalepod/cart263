  <h1>TheLibrary of Babel,by JorgeLuisBorges(1941)</h1>

  <p>By this art you may contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...</p>
  <p>TheAnatomyofMelancholy,part2,sect.II,mem.IV</p>

  <p> <span class = "secret">The universe</span> (which others call the Library) <span class = "secret"> is </span>composed of an indefinite and perhaps <span class = "secret"> infinite </span> number of hexagonal galleries,with vast air shafts between,surrounded by very low railings.From any of the hexagons one can see,interminably,the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable.</p>

  <p>Twenty shelves,five long shelves perside,cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling,<span class = "redacted"> scarcely exceeds </span> that of a normal book case. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which open on to another gallery,identical to the first and to all the rest.</p>

  <p>To the left and right</p>

  <p> of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first,one may sleep standing up; in the other,satisfy one's <span class = "redacted"> fecal necessities.</span> Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally  and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances.</p>

  <p>Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, <span class = "secret"> why this illusory duplication?</span>) ; </p>

  <p> <span class = "secret">I prefer to dream</span> that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite...Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is <span class = "redacted"> insufficient,incessant </span>...</p>
